# Web-Scraping_Job-Postings_Stepstone
Scraping with Python for my analysis of gender segregation/discrimination and gender stereotypes in job postings in my master thesis (academic research purpose)

In this project I did data collection for my master thesis.

Steps taken:
1. Scrape job postings from the German job portal "stepstone.de" (splitted into 7 notebooks, only one file shown: 1_0_Scrape stepstone Berufsfelder Sampling-Strategie_2019-07-20_search1-500.ipynb)
2. Concat data frames of 7 scrapings (2_1_Concat all dataframes.ipynb)
2. Preprocess text data for dictionary based classification (2_2_0 Preprocessing.ipynb)
3. Quantify amount of gender stereotypes contained in job postings (2_3_0 Data Mining job postings (sections).ipynb)
